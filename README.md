# TIC TAC TOE (USING IGRAPHICS)

Hello everyone! I am Rafsan Jani. This is, TIC TAC TOE, my first project of level 1, term 1. 

->Game Types:
1. Player vs Player
2. Player vs Computer

->In Player vs Player mode you can play in total four Modes:

1. Single Match : A normal Single match where you can win, lose & win.
2. 3 In a row : Here you can play 3 matches in a row. In this system, you can win, lose or draw. At last, the number of winning of each player will be counted & will give a final result (Win, lose or Draw).
3. 5 In a row : Here you can play 5 matches in a row. In this system, you can win, lose or draw. At last, the number of winning of each player will be counted & will give a final result (Win, lose or Draw).
4. Golden 3: This is the mode where you will must win or lose, no option to draw here. You will be in an infinity game loop until the final winner be found in this mode.

->In Player vs Computer mode you can play in two modes:

1. As first player (X)
2. As second player (0)
(The AI brain here used is too weak to judge your brain)

->Without these, you can go through some pages in the game.

1. "FACT" Page: where you can find some interesting facts about TIC TAC TOE.
2. "HOW TO PLAY" Page: where you will get some instructions about TIC TAC TOE. (All knows about it)
